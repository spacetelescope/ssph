<h1>SSPH DEMO</h1>
<p>
Auth: $auth<br>
Cookie: $cookie<br>
You are: $eppn<br>
IDP: $idp<br>

</ul>
<li> The Login button is a GET/POST to SSPH.  SSPH runs as a CGI in an Apache server that is protected by SSO.
<li> execution of the SSPH CGI means the authentication was successful
<li> SSPH inserts a record of the authentication into the database
<li> The SP checks for the authentication
	<ul>
	<li> via HTTP (with mutual shared secret authentication)
	<li> by looking into its own database (if SSPH is configured to do put answers there)
	</ul>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The SSPH prototype on etcbrady.stsci.edu is using a Microsoft SQL Server database on ppsdevdb1 for its own configuration and data storage.
</p>

<p>
This application is using a Postgres database running on banana.stsci.edu.  SSPH is inserting the authentication information directly into that database.  (It would have been MySQL except for some firewall issues.)
